# edcop-tools - DEPRECATED: tools now have their own repos under sealingtech/EDCOP-$TOOL
EDCOP-Tools are meant to be deployed on the EDCOP platform.  EDCOP-Tools is a compilation of DCO tools which are built on Docker and Kubernetes.  The goal of this project is to build an easily deployable and manageable DCO infrastructure which is fully integrated using DevOps practices.  This is still an early prototype at this phase.

Not that these tools are not optimized for your specific set of hardware.  To get the best performance, please refer to this guide:
[Optimization Guide](docs/optimization_guide.rst)

Each of these tools are designed to be starting points for building a common shared platform.  If you would like to build tools we have a few design patterns to follow.  View the [architecture guide](docs/edcop-tools-architecture.rst).
